    <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#483d8b;">Romeo and Juliet</h2>

    <h3 style="color:lightslategray">ACT 1</h3>

    <h3 style="color:lightslategray">PROLOGUE</h3>

    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity, <br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; <br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, <br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, <br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend, <br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

    <h3 style="color:lightslategray">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>

    <p><i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i></p>

    <h3 style="color:lightslategray">SAMPSON</h3>

    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

    <h3 style="color:lightslategray">GREGORY</h3>

    <p>No, <span style="color: orange;">for</span> then we should be colliers.</p>

    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>

    <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr>)</strong> is the standard
        markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> documents from a web server or from
        local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> describes the structure of a web page semantically and
        originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> elements are the building blocks of <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> pages. With <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> provides a
        means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
        lists, links, quotes and other items. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> elements are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span
            style="color: brown; background:lightgray;">&#60;img /></span> and <span
            style="color: brown; background:lightgray;">&#60;input /></span> directly introduce content into the page.
        Other tags such as <span style="color: brown; background:lightgray;">&#60;p></span> surround and provide
        information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>

    <p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> markup consists of several key components, including those
        called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> tags most commonly come in pairs like &#60;h1> and
        &#60;/h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &#60;img>. The first tag in
        such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing
        tags).</p>

    <p>Another important component is the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language ">HTML</abbr> document type
        declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>

    <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
